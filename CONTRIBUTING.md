## 🌿 Branching & Pull Request Workflow

### Default Branch: `dev`
All active development happens on the `dev` branch. The `main` branch is reserved for stable, production-ready releases only.

### How to Contribute
1. **Fork** the repository (external contributors) or create a branch (team members).
2. **Branch off `dev`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes**, commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
4. **Push to your fork/branch** and open a Pull Request **targeting `dev`**.
5. **Wait for CI checks** to pass (automated via GitHub Actions).
6. **Address review feedback** if requested.
7. **Merge** after approval (maintainers only).

### Branch Protection Rules
- ❌ Direct pushes to `main` are **not allowed**.
- ❌ Direct pushes to `dev` are **not allowed**.
- ✅ All changes must go through a Pull Request.
- ✅ CI status checks must pass before merging.
- ✅ At least 1 maintainer approval is required.

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/` — New features
- `fix/` — Bug fixes
- `docs/` — Documentation changes
- `test/` — Test additions/modifications
- `refactor/` — Code refactoring
- `chore/` — Maintenance tasks
